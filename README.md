# Journal-App

This app is part of the requirements to complete my Google Africa Challenge Scholarship- Android Developer Track. This app allows a user to write down whatever they would like to remember in the future. Users can view each journal by clicking on it, and clicking on the pencil icon on the menu to enable editting of the journal. Users can color-code each journal for ease of identification and even add labels (Inspiration, Work, Personal) to each journal.
